NeuroGEARS is joining the [Plexal](https://hereeast.com/lettings/innovation-centre/) technology innovation centre at [Here East](https://hereeast.com/), located within Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park at Stratford. We are moving closer to an exciting community of London startups, enterprises and academics who are coming together to imagine and create future technology.

The Plexal centre is a short five-minute walk from Hackney Wick train station, or you can also take the shuttle from Stratford station to Here East. Make sure to drop us a line if you are around.
