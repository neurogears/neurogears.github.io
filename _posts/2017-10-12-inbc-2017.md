The first Instituto de Neurociencias Bonsai Course ([INBC 2017](https://neurogears.org/inbc-2017/)) took place in the [campus of the Universidad Miguel Hernández](https://umh.es/), San Juan de Alicante, from 4-7 September. During this four day intensive course, participants were introduced to the [Bonsai](https://bonsai-rx.org/) visual language for reactive programming, and how to use it to design their own neuroscience experiments.

The topics covered precise synchronization of electrophysiology signals with video or other data streams; the design of data-acquisition and processing pipelines; and how to create interactive closed-loop behaviour systems. We also discussed how to track coloured or moving objects; how to use Bonsai to design behaviour tasks; and how to streamline analysis of large datasets, among many other things.

We were also very lucky to count with the participation of Aarón Cuevas López from the [Open-Ephys](https://open-ephys.org/) team as a guest teaching assistant. Aarón provided invaluable support and an introduction to the Open-Ephys data acquisition board.

By the end of the course, at least twelve different groups were able to successfully create their own experiments combining Arduino, Open-Ephys, webcams, NI-DAQ cards and PointGrey cameras.
