excerpt: Excited to present our latest developments on the HiveTracker project at UbiComp 2019!

The "[Ubiquitous Computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquitous_computing)" field of research integrates pervasive, wireless, embedded, wearable and/or mobile technologies to bridge the gaps between the digital and physical worlds.

[UbiComp](http://ubicomp.org/ubicomp2019) is a premier venue for presenting research in the design, development, deployment, evaluation and understanding of ubiquitous computing systems.

We demonstrated our 3d position tracker "[HiveTracker](https://HiveTracker.github.io)" and its latest [cross platform interface](https://github.com/hivetracker/hivetrackerjs). \\
Below, we visualize the position in a smartphone, and in a computer:

In our publication, we also present a characterization of the optical distortions of the HTC Vive lighthouses, as well as an proposal for an adaptive calibration and 3D reconstruction. You can download it here:
