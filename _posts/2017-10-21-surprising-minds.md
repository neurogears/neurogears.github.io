NeuroGEARS was commissioned to develop the software system for automation of the [Surprising Minds](https://everymind.github.io/SurprisingMinds/) interactive neuroscience exhibit at [Sea Life Brighton](https://www.visitsealife.com/brighton/). At Surprising Minds, you are invited to watch a short 30-second video clip while your eyes are recorded up close. You can then watch the replayed recording and see what your eyes do when you watch movies.

All the installation displays, data acquisition, and interactive systems are controlled using the [Bonsai](https://bonsai-rx.org/) visual programming language. The exhibit is now entirely automated and includes support for multiple languages. You can follow the history of the software development process on [GitHub](https://github.com/everymind/SurprisingMinds-Exhibit).

The exhibit is located next to the cuttlefish display tank in the main arcade of Sea Life Brighton. More information about the neuroscience research behind the Surprising Minds project can be found at the [EveryMind](https://everymind.github.io) website.
