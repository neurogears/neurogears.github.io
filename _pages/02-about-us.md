Brains interact with technology to turn imagination into reality.

NeuroGEARS is a technology company bridging Neuroscience, Games, Interaction, and Robotics, born from the desire to explore and create inspiring interfaces for augmenting human experience---and to make technology itself more accessible to everyone.

We are a network of explorers who like to imagine, use, and teach technology, having an extensive background building virtual and augmented reality systems, interactive installations, autonomous robots, and neuroscience research.

## Gonçalo Lopes

Gonçalo is a software engineer turned neuroscientist, fascinated by the behaviour of intelligent systems. With a background of applied research in virtual and augmented reality, parallel processing and autonomous agents, he joined the Champalimaud Neuroscience Programme in 2010, hoping to find better ways of building machines that learn by themselves. Gonçalo completed his PhD with Adam Kampff and Joe Paton, trying to understand the role of motor cortex in the control of movement in non-primate mammals.

Along the way, he extended his experience making interactive systems to rodents and other animal models. Gonçalo developed the Bonsai visual programming language as a way to rapidly prototype interactive neuroscience experiments.

# Collaborators

## João Frazão

![João]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/jfrazao.jpg){:class="img-profile"}

João is a roboticist and software engineer with a long experience developing real-time interactive applications. Having worked for pioneer tech startups in robotics and augmented reality, he is used to mixing sensors, actuators, and embedded systems to create next generation human computer interfaces. His projects span many fields, including technologically enhanced dance performances, interactive museums, and autonomous search and rescue robots.

More recently, João joined the Champalimaud Neuroscience Programme to help design high-end systems for electrophysiology. He also collaborated in the development of the Bonsai programming language.

## Pavel Itskov

![Pavel]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/pitskov.jpg){:class="img-profile"}

Pavel is a MD. and PhD in Neuroscience (SISSA, Trieste, Italy) with more than 15 years of research experience in the fields of animal and human physiology, and behaviour. He is passionate about developing new tools that make research easier, and more fun. For the past 6 years, Pavel has been working on elucidating the molecular and neuronal mechanisms controlling feeding behaviour in the lab of Carlos Ribeiro at Champalimaud Research, using *Drosophila melanogaster* as a model organism.

He is the main developer of the flyPAD, an automated device that uses capacitive sensors for high-throughput measurement of feeding behaviour in Drosophila.

## Cedric Honnet

![Cedric]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/chonnet.jpg){:class="img-profile"}

Cedric is a research engineer in the HCI group at ISIR, the robotics lab of Sorbonne University, Paris. With a background in embedded systems, he explores the connections between physical computing, interactivity and the arts by travelling the world of hackerspaces. Cedric worked as a firmware engineer and InterHacktivist at Sifteo in San Francisco, co-founded a couple of companies developing tangible interfaces, and started to create interactive systems worldwide.

He has worked on eTextile music controllers, virtual reality bike systems, interactive art pieces, modular implants, 3D positioning systems and many other Open Source projects.
